    <h2>Scott Sampson</h2>

<p>What's 75 million years old and brand spanking new? A teenage Utahceratops! Come to the 
Saroyan, armed with your best dinosaur roar, when Scott Sampson, Research Curator at the 
Utah Museum of Natural History, steps to the podium. Sampson's research has focused on the 
ecology and evolution of late Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has conducted fieldwork in a number 
    of countries in Africa.</p><br>
    

<p>Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born paleontologist who received his Ph.D. in zoology from the 
University of Toronto. His doctoral work focused on two new species of ceratopsids, or horned 
dinosaurs, from the Late Cretaceous of Montana, as well as the growth and function of certopsid 
    horns and frills.</p>

<p>Following graduation in 1993, Sampson spent a year working at the American Museum of Natural 
History in New York City, followed by five years as assistant professor of anatomy at the New 
York College of Osteopathic Medicine on Long Island. He arrived at the University of Utah 
accepting a dual position as assistant professor in the Department of Geology and Geophysics 
and curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Utah Museum of Natural History. His research 
interests largely revolve around the phylogenetics, functional morphology, and evolution of 
    Late Cretaceous dinosaurs.</p><br>

<p>In addition to his museum and laboratory-based studies, Sampson has conducted paleontological 
work in Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Madagascar, as well as the United States and Canada. He was 
also the on-air host for the Discovery Channel's Dinosaur Planet and recently completed a book, 
Dinosaur Odyssey: Fossil Threads in the Web of Life, which is one of the most 
    comprehensive surveys of dinosaurs and their worlds to date.</p>
